## 11.1 The `this` Pointer and Constant Member Functions
**Concept:**
In C++, the compiler provides each member function of a class with an implicit parameter called `this`, which points to the object through which the member function is called. A constant member function is one that does not modify the object through which it is called.

Consider the following class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Example {
    int x;
public:
    Example(int a) { x = a; }
    void setValue(int);
    int getValue();
};
```

With the Member function:

```cpp
int Example::getValue() {
    return x;
}
```

This function returns the value stored in an object of the class. For example:

```cpp
int main() {
    Example ob1(10), ob2(20);
    cout << ob1.getValue() << " " << ob2.getValue();
    return 0;
}
```

This program would output **`10 20`**.

Explanation:
Each instance of a class has its own copy of data members. For instance, ob1 has its x set to 10, while ob2 has its x set to 20.

The **`this`** pointer is an implicit parameter provided by the compiler to every member function of a class. It is a pointer to an object of the class. For example, the **`getValue`** function is equipped with a single parameter of type pointer to **`Example`**.

Inside a member function, the **`this`** pointer can be accessed using the reserved keyword **`this`**. It points to the object through which the member function is called and can be used to access any member of that object.

**Example:**

Consider the following class:

```cpp
class Example {
    int x;
public:
    Example(int a) { x = a; }
    void setValue(int);
    void printAddressAndValue();
};
```

With the member functions:

```cpp
void Example::setValue(int a) {
    x = a;
}

void Example::printAddressAndValue() {
    cout << "The object at address " << this << " has value " << this->x << endl;
}
```

In the main program:

```cpp
int main() {
    Example ob1(10), ob2(20);

    cout << "Addresses of objects are " << &ob1 << " and " << &ob2 << endl;

    ob1.printAddressAndValue();
    ob2.printAddressAndValue();

    return 0;
}
```

The program would output:

```css
Addresses of objects are 0x241ff5c and 0x241ff58
The object at address 0x241ff5c has value 10
The object at address 0x241ff58 has value 20
```

### Constant Member Functions

In C++, a `const` member function is a member function that promises not to modify the state of the object it is called on. When a member function is declared as `const`, it indicates to the compiler that it will not change any member variables of the object.

Consider the following class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Example {
    int x;
public:
    Example(int a) { x = a; }
    int getValue() const; // Declaring a const member function
};

int Example::getValue() const {
    return x; // Accessing the member variable x, but not modifying it
}
```

In this example, the **`getValue()`** function is declared as **`const`**, which means it promises not to modify the **`x`** member variable of the **`Example`** object it is called on.

Here's how you can use the const member function:

```cpp
int main() {
    Example obj(10);
    cout << "Value of x: " << obj.getValue() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The **`getValue()`** function can safely be called on a **`const`** object because it guarantees not to modify the object's state.


<a id="static-members"></a>
## 11.2 Static Members
In C++, static members are variables or functions that belong to the class itself rather than any specific object. They are shared among all objects of the class.

Consider the class **`Student`**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
  private:
  string name;
  int age;

  public:
  static int classStrength; // Initializing Static member variable keeping track of total students in the school class
  static int getClassStrength() { return classStrength; } // Initializing Static member function to check total students
  Student(string n, int a) {
    name = n;
    age = a;
    classStrength++;
  }
};
```

In this example, we have a static member variable **`classStrength`** which will be increased every time a new **`Student`** object is created.

Here's how you can use the static member:

```cpp
int Student::classStrength = 0;

int main() {
  Student stud1("Anthony", 15);
  cout << "Total students in class after Anthony joined: " << stud1.getClassStrength() << endl;
  Student stud2("Lisa", 16);
  cout << "Total students in class after Lisa joined: " << stud1.getClassStrength() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This illustrates the usage of static members in C++.

<a id="friends-of-classes"></a>
## 11.3 Friends of Classes
In C++, a **friend function** is a function that is not a member of a class but has access to the private members of the class. It can be useful when you need to grant special access to certain functions or classes.

### Declaring Friend Functions
To declare a function as a friend of a class, you use the `friend` keyword in the class definition. Here's the general format:

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    // Private members
public:
    // Public members

    friend ReturnType FriendFunctionName(ParameterType);
};
```

Complete example program using friend functions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Declaration of Car class
class Car {
  private:
  string make;
  string model;
  int year;

  public:
  Car(string ma, string mo, int yr) {
    make = ma;
    model = mo;
    year = yr;
  }
  friend void printDetails(Car); // Declaring a friend function to access private members
};

// Defining the friend function
void printDetails(Car car1) {
  cout << car1.make << " " << car1.model << " " << car1.year << endl;
}

int main() {
  Car car1("Ford", "Mustang GT", 1972);
  printDetails(car1); // calling the friend function
}
```

Here's a complete example program using 2 classes using **`friend`**:

```cpp
// Declaration of Car class
class Car {
private:
    int speed;
public:
    Car() { speed = 0; }
    void accelerate(int increment) { speed += increment; }
    int getSpeed() const { return speed; }

    friend class Driver; // Declare Driver class as a friend
};

// Declaration of Driver class
class Driver {
public:
    void drive(Car &car, int speed) {
        car.accelerate(speed);
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    Driver driver;

    driver.drive(myCar, 50); // Driver accelerates the car

    std::cout << "Current speed: " << myCar.getSpeed() << " mph\n";

    return 0;
}
```

<a id="memberwise-assignment"></a>
## 11.4 Memberwise Assignment
The = operator can be used to assign one object to another. In default conditions, it copies each and every member of one object to the other, hence known as **MemberWise Assignment**.

<a id="example114"></a>
Complete Example program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
  private:
  string name;
  int age;

  public:
  Student(string n, int a) {
    name = n;
    age = a;
  }
  void printDetails() {
    cout << name << " " << age << endl;
  }
};

int main() {
  Student obj1("Ankit Mishra", 22);
  Student obj2 = obj1; // Initialized a new object and assigned all obj1 members to it.
  Student obj3("Tony Stark", 24); // Declared object with initial values
  obj3 = obj1; // assigned obj1 members to obj3

  cout << "For obj1\n";
  obj1.printDetails();
  cout << "For obj2\n";
  obj2.printDetails();
  cout << "For obj3\n";
  obj3.printDetails();

  return 0;
}
```

In the program above, all the objects have same member values as **`obj1`** after the assigment.


<a id="copy-constructors"></a>
## 11.5 Copy Constructors
Copy Constructors are the special type of constructors that are called whenever a new object is initiliazed or assigned with the data of another object of same class.

The **Default** copy constructor copies each and every member from one object to another, known as memberwise assignment. The [example in 11.4](#example114) explains it perfectly.

### Issues with Default copy constructor

Mainly, When a class is declared with some members that have pointer to some entities, copying the exact pointer address can lead to issues, the example below explains that:



```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

class NumberArray {
  private:
  double *aPtr; // Declaring an array pointer
  int arraySize;

  public:
  NumberArray(int size, double value) {
    arraySize = size;
    aPtr = new double[arraySize]; // Dynamic allocation of an array
    setValue(value);
  }

  void printArray() const {
    for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
      cout << aPtr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }

  void setValue(double value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
      aPtr[i] = value;
    }
  }
};

int main() {

  NumberArray first(3, 5.2); // Making first object
  NumberArray second = first; // Making second object and using default copy with first

  cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
  cout << "Values in the First array before making changes in second: ";
  first.printArray();
  cout << "Values in the Second array before making changes in second: ";
  second.printArray();
  
  second.setValue(2.5); // Making changes in second array
  cout << "Values in the First array after making changes in second: ";
  first.printArray();
  cout << "Values in the Second array after making changes in second: ";
  second.printArray();

  return 0;
}
```

When modifications were made to the second array, the first array was also affected by the exact same changes. This occurred because the default copy constructor copied the pointer address created for the first array, resulting in both objects sharing the address of a singular array. This is one of the major deficiencies of the default copy constructor, which can be mitigated by implementing a **Programmer-defined copy constructor**.

### Programmer-defined copy constructor

Basic format of these constructors is same as the normal constructor, but we have the pass a reference to the same class in the arguments.

Here's a complete modified array program with the issue solved, we made it so the copy constructor does not copy pointer address.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

class NumberArray {
  private:
  double *aPtr; // Declaring an array pointer
  int arraySize;

  public:
  NumberArray(int size, double value) {
    arraySize = size;
    aPtr = new double[arraySize]; // Dynamic allocation of an array
    setValue(value);
  }
  
  // Programmer defined copy constructor, ignoring the pointer copy
  NumberArray(const NumberArray &obj) {
    arraySize = obj.arraySize;
    aPtr = new double[arraySize];
    for(int index = 0; index < arraySize; index++)
      aPtr[index] = obj.aPtr[index];
  }
 
  void printArray() const {
    for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
      cout << aPtr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }

  void setValue(double value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
      aPtr[i] = value;
    }
  }
};

int main() {

  NumberArray first(3, 5.2); // Making first object
  NumberArray second = first; // Making second object and using default copy with first

  cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
  cout << "Values in the First array before making changes in second: ";
  first.printArray();
  cout << "Values in the Second array before making changes in second: ";
  second.printArray();
  
  second.setValue(2.5); // Making changes in second array
  cout << "Values in the First array after making changes in second: ";
  first.printArray();
  cout << "Values in the Second array after making changes in second: ";
  second.printArray();

  return 0;
}
```

As we can observe, the changes in second array are not taking place in first array anymore. Programmer defined copy constructors can be used by programmers even when there's no issues in the default one. It depends on the project structure and needs.
